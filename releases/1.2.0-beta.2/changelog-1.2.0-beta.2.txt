##Fixes:
- Several useless objects removed from Surprise Box.
- Unimplemented elements removed from the Surprise Box due to crashes when the resource is pinned.
  - These elements generally weren't useful either besides their thermal properties in rare cases.
- Duplicants that leave a pocket dimension no longer play their falling animation for longer than they should.
- Attempt to fix bug causing duplicants leaving a pocket dimension to sometimes teleport to the bottom of the world.
- Pocket Dimensions no longer show "Space Exposure" when they are not exposed to space.
- Pocket Dimensions that show "Space Exposure" are now actually exposed to space.
- Extremely warm and over-pressurized elements no longer break out of their protective cage. 
##Changes:
- Surprise Box now spawns elements at their default mass and temperature (as if you had selected them in sandbox tools).
  - This should resolve issues where elements were instantly turning to a solid or gas tile, they should now slowly exchange temperature as debris first. 
- Several messages changed for clarity.
##Mod Support:
- Unimplemented Pocket Dimension generation API removed (it was never able to be used anyway).
- Twitch Integration dev tools slightly tweaked, notably searching for an event now only searches the *non-namespaced* ID.
    - Surprise Box dev tools show the proper name and tag of an entry and are sorted by tag.
