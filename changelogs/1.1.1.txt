# 1.1.1 (2023-07-08)

## Fixes
- Spawn Duplicant now properly only takes from users who voted in the most recent vote.
- Spawn Duplicant now attempts to spawn on a printing pod, which should greatly increase the chances of survival.
- Stress Down event no longer appears when your dupes are not stressed.
- Several events that spawned elements had their masses tweaked.
- Pocket dimensions could cause a save to be permanently broken on load.
- A certain pocket dimension was able to spawn even when you didn't have the digging skill it needed.
- Pocket dimensions no longer eject critters, make sure you rescue any critters you want before it closes!
- Surprise Box no longer tries to move the camera when it's opened.
- The items in a Surprise Box should be more interesting (and less artifacts).
- Snowy Bedrooms and Slimy Bedrooms events can no longer appear if you have no bedrooms.

## Changes
- Several messages were changed for clarity.
