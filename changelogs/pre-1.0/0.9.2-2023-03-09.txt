**0.9.2 (2023-03-09)**

Changes:
 - All user facing strings are now using translations.
   - No non-english translations are currently provided.
 - Toasts that have a click target now have an icon on the bottom right. The entire body of the toast still functions as a button.
 - An error handler has been added that suppresses all exceptions that happen in the execution of an event.
   - The error is logged to the log file in detail and a warning pop up informs the user that a problem occurred.
   - The voting system is turned off if an error occurs to attempt to prevent further damage.
   - This allows a user to save the game rather than having an event crash, and more easily places the blame on a specific event that can be turned off.
