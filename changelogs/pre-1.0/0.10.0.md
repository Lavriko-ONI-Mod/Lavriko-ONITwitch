# 0.10.0 (2023-03-16)

## Breaking Changes

- The `spawnSubDimensions` argument for adding custom pocket dimensions was removed
  - Note: this API is fairly unstable, I need to do something to it, it's probably best to avoid adding pocket dimensions for the time being
- Types in `EventInterface` were moved to `Core.CoreTypes`

## Changes:

- Everything has docs
- Added some missing toasts to events
